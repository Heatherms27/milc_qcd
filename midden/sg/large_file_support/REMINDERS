Change defines.h in propagating_form_factor to have the 
right value for MAX_ZONKED_LIGHT
#define MAX_ZONKED_LIGHT 5

don't forget to use timeslice layout for cl_bicg_prop_form.x
and layout_hyper for su3_clov_bi

Check PMAX for fourier transform

In clover_invert lattice.h make sure MAX_KAP is large enough:
#define MAX_KAP 6
is the way it is shipped.

Don't forget to make an appropriate local source file in
generic_clover/utilties
1) edit setup_smearing_main.c.  One line 55, nx is set.  Change
if necessary.
2) make -f Makefile_src new_src
3) run new_src and rename the local_smear output, if desired, e.g.,
 mv local_smear local_smear_nx=28
