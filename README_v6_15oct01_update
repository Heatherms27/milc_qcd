The update tar file milc_qcd_v6_15oct01_collab_update.tar.gz applies a
patch to the collaboration release of the code.  So start by unpacking
the main 15 Oct release.  Then unpack the update tar file to make
replacements and additions to the release.

Main changes since v6.15oct01

1. Modified f_meas.c to do multiple hits for psi-bar-psi.

2. Added g_vecdcomplexsum to com_mpi.c and com_vanilla.c.

3. Updated staggered hybrids code

    Added generic_ks/spectrum_hybrids4.c now simply a staggered option
    (Will eventually retire the whole ks_hybrids2 application).
    Added targets in ks_imp_dyn1 and ks_imp_dyn2

4. APE smearing

    Consolidated the several APE smearing routines in a single
    multipurpose generic/ape_smear.c and created a separate
    generic/project_su3_hit.c.  Converted to malloc'ing the temps.
    Applications and code affected:
      smooth_inst, generic_ks/spectrum_hybrids4.c, hvy_qpot
      string_break, clover_hybrids, wilson_hybrids
       
5. Field strength

    Consolidated the several field_strength routines to make a 
    single generic/field_strength.c. Converted to malloc'ing the temps.
    Applications affected:
      clover_hybrids, wilson_hybrids, generic_ks/spectrum_hybrids4.c
