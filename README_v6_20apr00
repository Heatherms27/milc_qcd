Main changes with version 6

Overview of changes

1. Header files 

    Headers common to all applications are now collected in an
    "include" directory.  The LATDEF macro has been dropped.  The
    "lattice.h" header name is now a standard name throughout, and is
    brought into generic directory compilations through <lattice.h> and
    the compiler flag -I.  This should remove headaches with stripping
    quotes when compiling with scripts, such as mpicc.  Just as the
    include/macros.h header file declares macros common to all
    applications, the defines.h header declares macros common to all
    targets within a given application.  It was separated from lattice.h
    mainly for readability and for checking consistency from one
    application to the next.  The params structure was also separated from
    lattice.h and is now in a separate header file "params.h", which is
    usually only needed in a setup.c compilation.  All headers are now
    protected by #ifndef's from multiple inclusion.  An effort has also
    been made to adhere to the practice that whenever any code refers to a
    nonstandard type or requires a macro, the appropriate defining header
    file is included at the top of the file.  In this way the order of
    including header files should not matter, as it did in previous
    versions of the code, and we stand a better chance of not missing a
    macro definition.

2.  New applications.  
       arb_dirac_eigen    Tom: a generalized Dirac eigensolver
	  		  Intended for more than one node but
	  	          needs work.
       arb_dirac_invert   Tom: a generalized Dirac spectrum calculator
	  		  Intended for more than one node but
	  	          needs work.
       ks_eigen           Kostas: KS eigenvalues (improved)
       ks_imp_dyn1        Doug and Kostas: KS improved one mass
       ks_imp_dyn2        Doug and Kostas: KS improved two masses
       schroed_ks_dyn     Urs: Schroedinger functional
       schroed_cl_inv     Urs: Schroedinger functional
       schroed_pg         Urs: Schroedinger functional
       symanzik_sl32      Urs: Generalized pure gauge

3.  New generic directories.  
       generic_pg collects code common to hvy_qpot, pure_gauge, schroed_pg.
       generic_schroed collects code common to Schroedinger functional apps

4.  Directories for improved action headers.
       generic_ks/imp_actions  All improved staggered action headers.
       generic/imp_actions     All improved gauge action headers.

5.  Code grooming.  As before we have tried to remove obsolete files, move 
    common code to generic directories, e.g. a new "make_lattice.c", move
    common macros to macros.h, and generally eliminate unnecessary duplication.

6.  C++ compatibility.  Various type casts have been added and extraneous
    prototype declarations have been removed to make it possible to compile
    the code under C++ with its strong type checking.  However, no
    constructs peculiar to C++ have been included, so the code remains
    ANSI C.

7.  Documentation
       doc/texinfodoc  Provides documentation for someone using the code
           or writing a custom application under the code.
