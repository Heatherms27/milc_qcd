MILC Version 6

September 20. 2002

There are so many applications in the MILC code suite that the code is
packaged in several tar files.  You may unpack selectively to get only
a portion of the code that interests you, or you may unpack the entire
code.

If you are reading this file, you have probably already completed the
first step in extracting the tar files containing the components of
the code.  There should also be a Make_unpack and a Make_contents file.

From here you may either do

 make -f Make_unpack all

or select an application <app> from the list below and

 make -f Make_unpack <app>

This process should unpack the components needed for the requested
application.  If you later decide to select another application, you
may use the same procedure.  However, if you switch to unpacking
"all", be advised that the reunpacking will undo any changes you may
have made to the code files.
