# Make file for exercising Make_test in all of the applications 
# in the working version of the code.

# You probably don't need to be so thorough.
# You can also just run Make_test for one application
# See the instructions in Make_test_template for testing your
# favorite application.

# Note: Neither arb_dirac_eigen nor arb_dirac_invert are debugged
# as parallel code.
