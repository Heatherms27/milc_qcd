List of code projects to be done:

Rename dslash to dslash_site throughout and dslash_on_temp to dslash_field etc.

Standardize lattice I/O.

Fold in Beat Jegerlehner's multimass clover inverter

Add FNAL clover propagator creation

Build FNAL-compatible form factor code.

Throughout:
  Continue moving toward field-major layout.

Continue testing prefetching and layout strategies.

Fix arb_dirac_eigen?  It has not been debugged for parallel running.

Merge clover_invert and wilson_invert with ifdefs where they differ in
a few places.

Measure momentum dependence of correlators in clover_invert and
wilson_invert.
