List of code projects to be done:

Remove nflavors1 and nflavors2 from the RHMC code and do something
sensible with the species counting -- e.g. a ONEMASS option ?

Fold in Beat Jegerlehner's multimass clover inverter

Build FNAL-compatible form factor code.

Throughout:
  Continue moving toward field-major layout.

Continue testing prefetching and layout strategies.

Fix arb_dirac_eigen?  It has not been debugged for parallel running.
