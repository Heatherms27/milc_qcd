Main changes since version 6.15oct01

1. SciDAC QMP support
   generic/com_qmp.c       Calls SciDAC QMP for message passing.

2. SciDAC compatibility    New entry points for QMP functionality
   generic/com_mpi.c       Includes multimessage consolidation
   generic/com_vanilla.c

3. generic_ks/dslash_fn.c  Multimessage version for Asqtad.
			   Also includes Tom B's DM/Du0 code

4. dclock()                Returns wall clock time now
   dclock_cpu()            Returns CPU clock time

5. generic_ks/fpi_2.c      Staggered fermion f_pi

6. generic_ks/spectrum_hybrids.c  Staggered fermion hybrids. New version.

7. ks_imp_dyn?/control.c   Changed input parameter format
   ks_imp_dyn?/setup.c     to systematize selection of spectrum
   ks_imp_dyn?/*.h         and related measurements.
   ks_imp_dyn?/Make_template Streamlined list of compilation targets

8. SSE support             Includes Don Holmgren's illustrative
   sse directory	   SSE assembly-coded variants of a few
   libraries/su3.h         library routines.  Also
   libraries/Make_SSE_nasm NASM assembly language for SSE

9. Double precision        Hack to convert entire code to double
   convert_f2d.csh         precision.
   generic/io_lat4_double.c Single precision I/O in 
   generic/io_wb3_double.c  a double precision context

10.f_meas.c                Multiple hits for psi-bar-psi and derivs
			   for quark number susceptibility

11. com_*.c                g_vecdcomplexsum added.
			   get_field and get_integer now require
			   a source node argument.

12. APE smearing

    Consolidated the several APE smearing routines in a single
    multipurpose generic/ape_smear.c and created a separate
    generic/project_su3_hit.c.  Converted to malloc'ing the temps.
    Applications and code affected:
      smooth_inst, generic_ks/spectrum_hybrids4.c, hvy_qpot
      string_break, clover_hybrids, wilson_hybrids
       
13. Field strength

    Consolidated the several field_strength routines to make a 
    single generic/field_strength.c. Converted to malloc'ing the temps.
    Applications affected:
      clover_hybrids, wilson_hybrids, generic_ks/spectrum_hybrids4.c

14. Retired         Applications that have fallen out of use.
    ks_hybrids2
    wilson_invert
    wilson_hybrids
