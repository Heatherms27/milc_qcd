This is MILC Version 7 code

Gradually version 6 code is being ported to it and new modules have
been added.

So far the following applications have been tested:

clover_dynamical
clover_invert
file_utilities
gluon_prop
heafy
ks_hl_spectrum
ks_imp_dyn
ks_imp_rhmc
ks_imp_invert_multi
ks_imp_utilities
pure_gauge
schroed_cl_inv
smooth_inst
wilson_static

Build the code with GNU make.  See the README file in this directory
for general instructions.

Here are highlights of the changes:

  Precision selection for QOP and QDP Asqtad fermion force 
     (single & multisource)
  Change to true residual stopping condition in single mass staggered
     and clover inverters.  Prepare for supporting FNAL relative residual.

  Support a variety of FNAL Wilson sources and propagator formats.
  Support for USQCD/SciDAC gauge file format in some applications.
  Dcache I/O support (FNAL)
  Drop site structure temps from gaugefix args.
  Drop site structure args from restrict_fourier args
  New interface for clover inverters.
  Z2 random number support in f_meas
  Support qopqdp-0.7.7 and later for fermion force.
  EVENANDODD KS matrix inversion now does odd-site polish
  Support for QCDOC multi Asqtad force and multi Asqtad inverter
  A few more less-used version 6 apps upgraded to version 7.

For version 7.4.0

  Mixed precision for QOP and QDP inverters, dslash, and supporting
  fermion links.
  Introduced precision selection "prec_pbp" for f_meas.c inversions.
  Made multicg option choice available to applications other than RHMC.
  Support qopqdp-0.7.7 including FNMAT version of multi fermion force
  "initialize_machine" now takes pointers to argc and **argv.
  Support USQCD metadata in SciDAC file output
  Print list of selected options during setup.
  Segregate inclusion of SciDAC headers for faster compilation times
  Libraries "make" builds both precisions independently.
  Make reporting of remapping time optional with macro REMAP.

For version 7.3.1

  Polished the parameter input format for the RHMC.
  Now allow comment lines beginning with # in parameter input.
  Added NERSC checksum to link trace.
  Added more precise timing to the QOP and QDP modules
  including remapping times.

For version 7.3.0

  Nearly complete QOP and QDP support for all major components of
  Asqtad molecular dynamics, including Doug's new multi fermion force.
  Reworked RHMC parameter input and Remez parameter output.
  Added support for more than two pseudofermion fields in RHMC
  Support different CG residuals for RHMC MD, FA, GR.
  Changed inline global make macros to C_GLOBAL_INLINE and
  SSE_GLOBAL_INLINE.
  Added file pointer to get_i, get_f, etc.
  Added nrestart to KS CG routines throughout.
  (These last changes affect most application subdirectories.)

For version 7.2.2

  Upgrade RHMC code to do concurrent EOS calculations
  Fix p4 capability in ks_imp_dyn.
  Distinguish inverter residuals for mol dyn and action.

For version 7.2.1

  Start supporting the QOP/QDP package

For version 7.2.0

  Port clover_dynamical to Version 7
 
  Add RHMC code and rearrange multicg and multi fermion force procedures
 
  Add Level 3 wrappers for Level 3 multicg and multi fermion force
 
  Begin adding plaquette and link trace to MILC file metadata.
 
  Add Urs's gluon_prop

For version 7.1.12

  Fix Level 3 fermion force coef usage

  Support new level 3 interface for asqtad_invert and asqtad_force

  Add clover_invert to Version 7.

For version 7.1.11

  Support new Level 3 API for Asqtad fermion force and inverter
    Support for QOP/QDP awaits upgrade.

  Change write_ksprop_info_item to use fwrite instead of fprintf

  Add MILC imitations of Level 3 force and inverter for testing

  Make dummy QCDML be legitimate XML

For previous versions 7

 1. Unified Makefile replaces Make_vanilla Make_linux_mpi, etc.
    See various macros in Makefile, including MPP.
    Requires GNU make.
