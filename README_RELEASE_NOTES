This is a work in progress.

This is the beginning of version 7 of the MILC code.

So far it contains only the following applications:

file-utilities
ks_imp_dyn
ks_imp_utilities
ks_imp_invert_multi
ks_hl_spectrum

Build the code with GNU make.

Here are the new features so far:

 1. Unified Makefile replaces Make_vanilla Make_linux_mpi, etc.
    See various macros in Makefile, including MPP.
    Requires GNU make.

 2. Unified support for single and double precision
    See the PRECISION macro in Makefile.

 3. Support for SciDAC QIO
    See the WANTQIO macro in Makefile

 4. Support for SciDAC QDP
    See the WANTQDP macro in Makefile

 5. Support for single and double precision SSE
    Uses the same SSE and SSE_INLINE macros as in version 6,
    except that P3 or P4 compiler macros are not used.

 6. Standalone MILC/FNAL to SciDAC file conversion in file_utilities.

 7. Uses only temp vectors for dslash_fn and d_congrad5_fn.

 8. New applications:

    ks_hl_spectrum: Ludmila's MILC version for the clover heavy
      staggered light spectrum.
    ks_imp_invert_multi: multimass inversion
    ks_imp_utilities: for checking fermion force and inverter

 9. New file_utilities
    Conversion among binary file types for KS and Wilson propagators.
    Differencing for propagator files.

10. Unified I/O for KS propagators supporting Wingate, Fermilab
    and SciDAC formats.

11. Unified I/O for Wilson propagators supporitng MILC, Fermilab,
    and SciDAC formats.

12. Time-slice checksums for Fermilab KS and Wilson propagators.

13. QCDOC support - including the SciDAC Level 3 inverter

14. C-coded optimized fermion force term for QCDOC

15. An assortment of C-inline routines

16. Support for SciDAC Level 3 QOP for QCDOC

17. Support for ILDG lattice formats and QIO parallel I/O.

18. Few-gather and few-sum versions of the MILC inverter.

19. Support for parallel I/O and ILDG LFN

20. Modified multimass inverter to allow arbitrary source points.
