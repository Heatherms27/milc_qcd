This is MILC Version 7 code

Gradually version 6 code is being ported to it and new modules have
been added.

So far only the following applications have been tested:

clover_dynamical
clover_invert
file_utilities
gluon_prop
ks_hl_spectrum
ks_imp_dyn
ks_imp_rhmc
ks_imp_invert_multi
ks_imp_utilities
pure_gauge
schroed_cl_inv

Build the code with GNU make.  See the README file in this directory
for general instructions.

Here are highlights of the new features:

For version 7.3.2

  Mixed precision for QOP and QDP inverters, dslash, and supporting
  fermion links.
  Made multicg option choice available to applications other than RHMC.
  "initialize_machine" takes pointers to argc and **argv.
  Support USQCD metadata in SciDAC file output
  Print list of selected options during setup.
  Segregate inclusion of SciDAC headers for faster compilation times
  Libraries make builds both precisions.

For version 7.3.1

  Polished the parameter input format for the RHMC.
  Now allow comment lines beginning with # in parameter input.
  Added NERSC checksum to link trace.
  Added more precise timing to the QOP and QDP modules
  including remapping times.

For version 7.3.0

  Nearly complete QOP and QDP support for all major components of
  Asqtad molecular dynamics, including Doug's new multi fermion force.
  Reworked RHMC parameter input and Remez parameter output.
  Added support for more than two pseudofermion fields in RHMC
  Support different CG residuals for RHMC MD, FA, GR.
  Changed inline global make macros to C_GLOBAL_INLINE and
  SSE_GLOBAL_INLINE.
  Added file pointer to get_i, get_f, etc.
  Added nrestart to KS CG routines throughout.
  (These last changes affect most application subdirectories.)

For version 7.2.2

  Upgrade RHMC code to do concurrent EOS calculations
  Fix p4 capability in ks_imp_dyn.
  Distinguish inverter residuals for mol dyn and action.

For version 7.2.1

  Start supporting the QOP/QDP package
  Split out fermion_links_fn from quark_stuff but no QOP support
    for fat and long link generation, yet.
 
  Make sample files precision-specific

For version 7.2.0.1

  Correct the weights for QOP_asqtad_force_multi in fermion_force_asqtad_qop.c
  Restore clobbered sse directory.

For version 7.2.0

  Port clover_dynamical to Version 7
 
  Add RHMC code and rearrange multicg and multi fermion force procedures
 
  Add Level 3 wrappers for Level 3 multicg and multi fermion force
 
  Begin adding plaquette and link trace to MILC file metadata.
 
  Add Urs's gluon_prop

For version 7.1.12

  Fix Level 3 fermion force coef usage

  Support new level 3 interface for asqtad_invert and asqtad_force

  Add clover_invert to Version 7.

For version 7.1.11

  Support new Level 3 API for Asqtad fermion force and inverter
    Support for QOP/QDP awaits upgrade.

  Change write_ksprop_info_item to use fwrite instead of fprintf

  Add MILC imitations of Level 3 force and inverter for testing

  Make dummy QCDML be legitimate XML

For previous versions 7

 1. Unified Makefile replaces Make_vanilla Make_linux_mpi, etc.
    See various macros in Makefile, including MPP.
    Requires GNU make.

 2. Unified support for single and double precision
    See the PRECISION macro in Makefile.

 3. Support for SciDAC QIO
    See the WANTQIO macro in Makefile

 4. Support for SciDAC QDP
    See the WANTQDP macro in Makefile

 5. Support for single and double precision SSE
    Uses the same SSE and SSE_INLINE macros as in version 6,
    except that P3 or P4 compiler macros are not used.

 6. Standalone MILC/FNAL to SciDAC file conversion in file_utilities.

 7. Uses only temp vectors for dslash_fn and d_congrad5_fn.

 8. New applications:

    ks_hl_spectrum: Ludmila's MILC version for the clover heavy
      staggered light spectrum.
    ks_imp_invert_multi: multimass inversion
    ks_imp_utilities: for checking fermion force and inverter

 9. New file_utilities
    Conversion among binary file types for KS and Wilson propagators.
    Differencing for propagator files.

10. Unified I/O for KS propagators supporting Wingate, Fermilab
    and SciDAC formats.

11. Unified I/O for Wilson propagators supporitng MILC, Fermilab,
    and SciDAC formats.

12. Time-slice checksums for Fermilab KS and Wilson propagators.

13. QCDOC support - including the SciDAC Level 3 inverter

14. C-coded optimized fermion force term for QCDOC

15. An assortment of C-inline routines

16. Support for SciDAC Level 3 QOP for QCDOC

17. Support for ILDG lattice formats and QIO parallel I/O.

18. Few-gather and few-sum versions of the MILC inverter.

19. Support for parallel I/O and ILDG LFN

20. Modified multimass inverter to allow arbitrary source points.

21. Add C versions of MILC QOP wrappers.  Make wrappers support QOP/QDP.
